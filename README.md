# InfoCities  

Bootcamp Project #1, the beginning framework of a hypothetical social media website for travelers. Assignment requirements were to utilize 2 external APIs and store data on Firebase's Realtime Database.

## Primary Functionality

* City pages dynamically created by querying information stored in Firebase
* City pages query Seatgeek, OpenWeatherMap, and Kayak APIs to display information on sidebar
* Logged in users can create To-Do Lists for each city that will be stored in Firebase
* Logged in users can visit their personal information page, which displays their To-Do lists and an interactive map of the cities they have marked as having visited

## Technology Stack

* Styled with Bootstrap
* User Signups and Logins through Firebase
* Data Storage through Firebase
* Deployed on Github Pages
